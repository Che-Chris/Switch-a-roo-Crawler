<div class="md"><p>My cat has multiple plates and bowls for his food, but he prefers his food to be imbued with essence of floor so he drags it off the plate and eats off the floor</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>You just changed my cat&#39;s whole diet. And probably the smell of my kitchen. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats eat cold meat like it&#39;s the most delicious food ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat won&#39;t typically eat meat, he&#39;ll only eat the dry cat food. I can leave out almost anything and he won&#39;t touch it, and he will only occasionally nibble bits of bacon or ham that I insistently put infront of his face. He also won&#39;t drink water unless it&#39;s coming out of the faucet. If I try and leave water in a bowl, he&#39;ll just try and flip it over. He is also afraid of bugs. He is afraid of going outside. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand how my cat acquired this personality, but it is what it is. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat prefers her food at any damn temperature it happens to be at 6:30 in he morning on my only day off work. She lets me know my sitting on my head and meowing as loudly as she possibly can. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I feed my cats raw food and it come in half pound s Alex plastic bags which are frozen and quite thin.</p>

<p>For a few years now I have been throwing one in a bowl of hot tap water while i get ready for work and when it&#39;s time to leave i serve it at pretty much body temperature. And they love it.</p>

<p>Before I would defrost it but not heat it and they certainly were never lit up about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat gets room temperature canned food, and if she doesn&#39;t eat it, it goes away until next feeding time. </p>

<p>She very quickly learned to eat what I give her (which is great food) and rarely lets it sitting. </p>

<p>So much better to have a pet on a schedule. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Auggie is going to eat whatever the fuck I serve him and at whatever temperate it happens to be, and his fat ass is going to like it. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Try cracking that can open and not putting it directly down. I dare you. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats love cold meat. They get to eat bits of my sandwich before I do. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll tell you when it <strong>is</strong> important to heat their food...</p>

<p><em>It&#39;s when they have a respiratory infection. You need to keep them eating, but they lose their appetite due to not being able to smell the food. So serve them a stinky wet food and heat it up.</em> </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Have to disagree with you.  My current cat will eat cold canned food or tuna.  So make that &quot;some.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s 100.4 degrees, F. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I might try this with one of my cats that will rarely eat soft food.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Does the temp of the water matter?  My cat won&#39;t drink water from her bowl but loves it from the sink or shower.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In my experience cats are animals and as animals they will eat any damn thing they sniff and subsequently chew - up to and including string, couch fluff, Xbox Controllers, and their own shit.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t seem to be particularly picky about the temperature of any of these things. But again that&#39;s my experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My 3 cats really enjoy their room temp kibbles. I don&#39;t think I could microwave wet food, that would stink up the house. 
I have found that making a liquid food warm helps our middle kitty eat more. He&#39;s underweight so I make him &#39;Sniff Soup&#39; (Sniff is his name, short for Calcifer)
It&#39;s hot water, bone broth powder (free of any cat toxic spices) and some cream cheese melted in, not too much because cats technically aren&#39;t supposed to have dairy. 
After its mixed it&#39;s cooled down a bit and not hot. He loves it. Have to guard him though because the other two kitties don&#39;t need to gain weight at all. Especially the youngest, trying to slim him down. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I fed my cat ice cold meat and fish the other day. He ates it all.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>We had a cat who ate lettuce like it was crack.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>TIL people will take anything on Wikipedia as the gospel before doing their own research.. there&#39;s no evidence proving this to be true whatsoever, it&#39;s merely a theory people like to throw around. All we know for sure is that on average cats prefer their food around that temperature rather than colder meals. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat eats strawberry yogurt. </p>

<p>That is all  </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Huh. My mom used to mix dry cat food with butter, microwave that and feed it to our cats. Cats seemed to prefer it over all other food, my mom always thought it was because of the little bit of butter she put in... but it might just be the temperature..</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So. .. someone should invent a car food dish that keeps the food at that temp. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat likes ice cream </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yeah my cat eats food at any temperature cuz she&#39;s a fat fuck</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat refuses to eat anything that is warm and loves food straight out of the fridge. Guess they have been conditioned enough</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This is bullshit that references an unsourced article on a cat website. There&#39;s plenty of anecdotal evidence to the contrary (I and many others feed cold food to cats without issue). Plus it&#39;s impossible to know that cats like warm food &quot;because it simulates a fresh kill&quot;.  </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I had a cat who loved ice-cream...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat eats three day old frozen pizza. Happily. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Two of my cats will only eat room temp food. One is a pig and will eat food out of the fridge so he gets the leftovers from breakfast at dinner time. I have to guard the other cats while they eat. Pig inhales his meal in about 30 seconds and then runs to finish off the food of the two much slower eaters (10 minutes each for those slowpokes and I just have to stand there watching them or they get nothing).</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This is also true for werewolves. </p>

<p>Source: Vietnam 1968 or 1969</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is true for all cats. Room temperature seems fine for every cat I&#39;ve had. Open a can of cat food from the pantry (room temperature... so like 28 C) and all of them come running. Sometimes I can&#39;t even put it down because they&#39;re butting their head against my hand to try and eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat must be broken. She prefers raw meat straight out of the fridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true.  I&#39;va had many cats.  I sometime feed them deli turkey or bologna from the fridge.   Or shrimp and chicken breast.  I also put half empty cans of food in the fridge for later.  All my cats always devour it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat likes beer and goes crazy for crisps, but when I&#39;m making sushi and generously give him a little tuna or salmon he won&#39;t touch it. I don&#39;t get him.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat rejected this morning&#39;s piping hot food with extreme prejudice.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I too read the whole Cat article after someone linked to it in that gif thread. Nice!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>TIL this is bullshit.</p>

<p>I ONLY feed my cat with a mix of canned food, dry food and 1/2 teaspoon of stool softener (vet said to) with 37 F degree water mixed into it and the wet food is from the refrigerator.... </p>

<p>For those of you who dont know this, 37 degrees F is COLD water- and she digs into it and eats the whole thing faster than I expect a cat to do...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I was literally just thinking about this!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just watched nine lives and the cat is pissed because his good is cold. But it&#39;s fish.</p>

<p>A cat knows what it&#39;s killed - so presumably it doesn&#39;t like warm fish?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This is valuable information</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I just want to know how the fuck they can go from a deep sleep to attacking whatever disturbs them in 0.1 seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>TIL that cats give fucks.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Huh just earlier today i had a fried tell me her cat really like cat food cold out of the fridge, as in wolf it all down then throw up from it. Room temp food just get nibbled at every so often. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat refuses any fresh food ever. Only crunchy dry food. I feed him premium grade no filler stuffs. Which he enjoys better than others I have gotten him in the past. Any recommendations for this?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Not my cats. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats only eat dry food; they know nothing of wet or warm food and never will!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat doesn&#39;t like hot/warm food. Whenever we give something that is still hot, he makes a weird expression and eats more slowly. It might be that he&#39;s used to cold/room temperature food.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My Bombay somtimes takes breaks from eating the colder food. He will eat half, and come back to eat the second half a little while later. Non-refrigerated food gets devoured in one sitting, though. But he never rejected any food, based on temperature. Could also be that my cat is not very picky in general. He has no brand or ingredient preferences, either.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Our cat gives no fucks, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Our cats savage chippy chips (for americans, think french fries but thicker, but not as thick as a wedge) so I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine with tinned food being cold</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Is that why they leave like 90% of what i serve them on their plate? </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>what is that in freedom units?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I wonder if human&#39;s addiction to warm food means the same. I mean, some of our food could be eaten cold but when it&#39;s hot it is tastier.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My old ice cream loving cat would disagree with this.  He <em>really</em> loved ice cream. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My dopy cat eats anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Our cat eats half a can of wet food for dinner every day. And she eats the refrigerated half without hesitation. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Then why did my cat like to kill bunnies and stash them under the cellar stairs to munch on secretly throughout the week?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Oh great. TIL is turning into shitty lifeprotips... </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>And now the dilemma is whether or not I tell my wife she&#39;s been right the whole time</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats will eat pretty much anything you put in front of their fat faces. Like...I could be eating  a pineapple and those little fatties think they need to try it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I usually submerge my cats food pouch in a jug of warm water before giving it to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>This raises a (serious) question: where does this instinct come from? I mean, this is not something a domesticated cat can learn from somewhere (as most don&#39;t know how to use wikipedia).</p>

<p>So are these instincts somehow programmed into a cat&#39;s genome? If yes, then how? And how does that change a cat&#39;s brain to the point where this behavior emerges?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I learned that my dog is the same way.  He usually won&#39;t eat cold canned dog food unless he&#39;s really hungry.  Warm it up and he&#39;s fine.  Unfortunately warming up canned dog food is pretty gross.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Expect this to be the next product that Wiskas come out with. A cat-food warming tray/bowl.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I have a distinct feeling about cats, they are fucking vile. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat eats Popsicles sometimes  </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Anecdotal evidence and all, but my cats go batshit over pate that&#39;s come from the fridge</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>TIL that humans have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring their food to be fresh and not be left out being presented with rotten food.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Wonder if other cats are like this too</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to worry because my cat hasn&#39;t been eating, so maybe it&#39;s temperature preference. Although, come to think of it, maybe my cat hasn&#39;t been eating because I haven&#39;t ever left food out for it. Actually, you know what? It could be because I don&#39;t have a cat. That might be it</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I wonder if that&#39;s what drew cats to humans in the first place, a species that could cook.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Hmm, they may &quot;prefer&quot; it, but they&#39;re certainly not averse to eating food that has been chilled.  I have been serving my cats wet food out straight of the fridge for many years, and they&#39;ve never turned it down yet. (Except for one weirdo I had that refused to eat anything but dry food.)</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So 100 F? Boiling water is the same as a fresh kill?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I guess no one gave my cat the memo.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>so why do i have to pay a cat tax every time i make a cold cut sandwich?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>suspicions confirmed, cats are still picky dicks.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I used to feed my kitties wet food, but since the can is so big I would put the uneaten portion in the fridge. I don&#39;t think they minded the temperature. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat has a preference for a bowl that is no more than 1/4th empty. If it is more than 1/4th empty then it is THE END OF THE WORLD AND EVERYONE MUST KNOW OF OUR IMPEDING DEATH BY STARVATION!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Won&#39;t stop my cat from assaulting us at around 5 everyday because we haven&#39;t fed him yet. Just room temperature wet food and he goes banana sandwich on ua</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>how come carrion eaters don&#39;t get sick, but other animals like people and cats cant eat rotting meat?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat will devour wet food even if it&#39;s just out of the fridge. He also routinely goes for dog food, loaves of bread on the counter, licking dirty dishes and crumbs from empty pizza boxes. Pretty sure he was a stray before I adopted him, but I&#39;ve had him for 9 years now and his appetite is the same lol. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My rescue kitten will not eat anything unless it has been refrigerated. She&#39;s very picky with the wet food. I thought it was kinda weird.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Did my comment about cat anatomy 13 hours ago inspire a learning spree?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Somehow this thread was one of the greatest ones I&#39;ve read in a while. Makes me miss having a cat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Huh, very interesting. I feed my cat half a can of wet food in the morning (room temperature). I put the other half in the fridge and he always eats it cold in the afternoons/evenings. He&#39;s never once refused the cold food. What a good boy.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Then why in Earth does my cat (fittingly named Hobbes) throw up his food if it&#39;s warm but keeps it down when it&#39;s cold? I swear I&#39;ll never understand these animals.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>what&#39;s the deal with them and water? mine doesn&#39;t like it in a bowl but begs to drink from faucet every time I go in bathroom</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats eat cold cuts right from the fridge</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I prepare a special raw meat diet for my three cats. It takes about an hour a month to mix it up (it includes like a dozen vitamins, eggs, etc) and freeze it, and it actually works out to be cheaper than feeding them regular cat food.</p>

<p>Every night I take one out of the freezer for the next day. At fridge temperature the cats go crazy for it. </p>

<p>The problem is, sometimes if I put it on the wrong level of the fridge or forget to take it out the night before, they&#39;re basically having raw meat ice cream as I scrape whatever has managed to thaw off the sides.</p>

<p>I think I was going to make the point that they refused to eat it frozen, but then I realized they don&#39;t actually care and will eat anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I keep her wet food in the fridge, and she will shank me in the nostril/ear if I&#39;m not up at breakfast time every morning. Safe to say she doesn&#39;t mind the tempurature disparity.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Man cats are the worst.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Is that why stray cats will dig through my garbage on occasion to eat left over chicken/steak bones that are 3 days old? </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat loves sliced Turkey out of the fridge so go figure</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat likes the crunchy dry food, and only the crunchy dry food. He will <em>occasionally</em> nibble at salmon skin or deli turkey, but turns his nose up at wet food, treats, or anything other than his crunchies. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My car would only ever eat dry cat food.  I wonder what sorta kill that represented. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Humans do the same thing. Why do you think we don&#39;t like cold spaghetti?</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Mine eats raw, cold and frozen with no problem, wild cats eat frozen prey all the time in the winter, the cold tends to preserve the meat. Although it is true most cats do prefer their food room temperature. Less of a luxury when there&#39;s other hungry cats trying to eat while you wait for food to defrost</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>The sell refrigerated cat food in my grocery. It was expensive so naturally I thought my cat would love it. She would never eat it. Now I know why. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I tried microwaving my cats food once. Zero interest. :(</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>BS</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>In Larry Niven&#39;s Known Space series, this is what the Kzin (somewhat cat-like aliens) use microwaves for.  I can&#39;t recall if they learned the concept of cooking from one of their slave races or if they artificially heated their meat before then.  I did like the detail that one of the best things about enslaving humans was having them make salmon ice cream and vodka floats for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Cold, hot, my cat gives no fucks what temperature his wet food is. If he can reach it with his mouth he&#39;ll eat it.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats eat cold cat food. I&#39;m pretty sure they can smell bad meat.</p>

<p>Oh and cold pizza. They love the cheese. </p>

<p>Oh and they&#39;ll lick the butter off toast if turn your back on them the little bastards.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats seem to have no problem eating cold canned food leftovers straight from the fridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Mine eats room temperature dry food. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>So my cat loves pumpkin puree and we give it to him sometimes to help him poop more regular.  He loves it when it&#39;s super cold from the fridge.  If it sits out too long he won&#39;t eat it.  Strange.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Bah. Not true. Cats are as individual as humans. Can&#39;t generalize mate. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Microwaving the food is a common suggestion for older/chronically ill cats that don&#39;t want to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My parents used to microwave the cats food to warm it up...  Sometimes I think that cat got better treatment than I did growing up <em>LOL</em></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>not mine. they will eat it straight out of the fridge or fresh out of the can.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat loves cold turkey slices and or bacon.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Our cats will eat anything we give em, they can&#39;t be choosy!</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I guess this ties in with the fact that cats have no problem eating your dead body within hours of you dying while dogs will wait days to weeks before doing so as dogs are much more tolerant of rotting food. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Thank for this info!  My cat loves to eat &#39;canned cat food&#39; when at home, but simply refuses to eat it at my parents house.  Well they keep it in an earth cellar (naturally cool to do being underground) and its typically wayyyy cooler than 311.15° K</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat won&#39;t eat his food when I first take it out of the fridge. He&#39;ll walk around the bowl for an hour or so until the food warms up and then he&#39;ll devour it.</p>

<p>Interesting to find that it&#39;s a known preference, I thought it was just mine being a brat.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Are cats closer to the natural world than dogs? Because my dogs likes munchos and red vines. </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cats temperature preference is &quot;anything.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Holy shit why wont you use fucking Farenheit for once. Fuckin non americans.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat goes crazy over the smell of bleach.  </p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat just likes pizza, any temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>most people also over feed their cats. a large percentage of the time your cat is uninterested in food is due to them not being that fn hungry. just bc you over eat doesnt mean your cats wants to.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Useful, thank you. <sup><sup><sup>I</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>don&#39;t</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>have</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>a</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>cat</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup>yet</sup></sup></sup></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>this explains why my cat refuses to eat pet meat from the butcher, until i zap it in the microwave.. damn you Princeton!!!!...</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Pretty much every thread in this comment section is about people saying their cat is a picky asshole.</p>

<p>You know what? Dogs don&#39;t give a fuck if their food is hot or cold, and if they see a person eating it, it tastes even better.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I am not certain that this is necessarily true. I have a male cat that should I over feed him a treat eats his fill and then indulges in behavior that implies he wants to save the leftovers for later. This implies that the cat will accept ambient temperature food.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My cat loves cold food. I call bullshit on this study.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>Yeah my cats go nuts for cold chicken scraps freshly trimmed.</p>

<p>Guess they&#39;d die pretty quick in the wild lol.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>My dad&#39;s cat used to eat cold tunafish straight out of the fridge all the time. Hmmm.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a cat... They aren&#39;t the sharpest crayons in the box.</p>
</div>
<div class="md"><p>I get downvoted for saying cats are stupid, useless, and barely adapt. No matter how many downvotes I get it&#39;s still true, you may love and snuggle your cat but it&#39;s seriously too stupid to even care and the downvotes don&#39;t change that ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>

<div class="md"><p>Can people stop citing Wikipedia for everything? It&#39;s not a credible source.</p>
